In Peru the wildest landscapes ‚Äì from frozen Andean peaks to the deep Amazon ‚Äì help us re-forge our connection to the natural world. It is also a cultural stew, where diverse peoples live side by side, negotiating modern life with humor and aplomb. Beyond that, the cuisine alone makes it worth the trip.
